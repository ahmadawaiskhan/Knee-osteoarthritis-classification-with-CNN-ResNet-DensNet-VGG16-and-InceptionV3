•	Knee Osteoarthritis Classification Models: 
We developed and trained a set of ten deep learning models designed for the analysis of knee X-ray images. These models included different algorithms
e.g.  CNN, ResNet, DenseNet, InceptionV3, and VGG16. We carefully created two models for each algorithm: one for Binary classification and another
for Multiclass classification. The Binary Classification model was dedicated to determining whether a patient's condition was positive or negative,
and in the event of a positive classification, we subsequently utilized the Multiclass Classification model to precisely assess the stage of knee osteoarthritis
affecting the patient.

Model Deployment
•	Knee Osteoarthritis grading website: 
Develop a website and deploy Knee Osteoarthritis Classification Model in python Django Framework in which knee osteoarthritis patient will give its knee X-ray Image
to the website and in response it will predict the stage of knee osteoarthritis
